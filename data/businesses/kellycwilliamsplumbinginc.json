  "research": "Based on the provided identifiers, it appears there is a confusion because the business listed is not located in Alabama, but rather in Georgia.\n\n### Business Information:\n- **Location and Service Areas**: The business is located at 37 Fortson Rd, Fortson, GA 31808, and it does not operate in Alabama[2].\n- **Years in Operation**: The business has been in operation since 1974 and was incorporated on December 14, 2000[2].\n\n### Services & Specialties:\nSince the business is not in Alabama, the services and specialties listed are for the Georgia location:\n- **Types of Services Offered**: General plumbing services, but specific details are not provided for this location[2].\n- **Emergency Service Availability**: Not specified for this location, but reviews suggest they offer prompt and emergency services[3].\n\n### Customer Reviews & Reputation:\n- **Review Summaries**: Customers praise the business for its professionalism, prompt service, and fair pricing. Examples include quick responses to emergencies, thorough work, and reasonable prices[3].\n- **BBB Rating and Status**: The business is not BBB accredited and does not have a BBB rating due to insufficient information[2].\n- **Common Customer Feedback Themes**: Professionalism, prompt service, fair pricing, and excellent customer service[3].\n\n### Owner & Staff:\n- **Owner/Management Information**: Mr. Kelly Williams is the President and a key contact for the business[2].\n- **Staff Qualifications and Professional Certifications**: There is no specific information provided about staff qualifications or certifications for this business.\n\nGiven the business is located in Georgia and not Alabama, there is no Alabama-specific information available for Kelly C. Williams Plumbing, Inc. The details provided are for the Georgia-based business. If you are looking for information on a different business with a similar name in Alabama, additional identifiers would be necessary to locate the correct business.",
